# Canis Hackaton @ April, 2023

This repository contains the final frontend website which is created using ReactJS Framework. We used JavaScript, JSX, HTML, and CSS to implmenet this web-app. For charts, ApexChart (https://apexcharts.com/) is used. A live view of this repository is also available at fakeortrue.netlify.app. You can check it right now!

## Cloning
You can clone this repository using `git clone` command.

## Installing and Running
First, make sure you have `node`, `npm`, and `create-react-app` installed on your machine. You also need `yarn` as I always use it to add modules! It's two times faster.. :)
Then, change the directory to the root of this project using `cd` command. Now, you can use `npm i`or `yarn install` (preferred) to install all the needed modules.
Finally, you can use `npm start` or `yarn start` (preferred) to start the project. You can see the preview of the web application at `localhost:3000`. (The port may change if 3000 is busy at your running time!)
